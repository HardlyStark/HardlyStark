# Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## About Me
I'm [ Hardly Stark ]( https://Github.com/HardlyStark )

I'm a Cybersecurity Detective & CEO at *[ Eduvention ](https://Github.com/Eduvention)*

Most people know me as *[ Hardly Gods ](https://Github.com/HardlyGods)* but my other name is *[ Hardly Stark ]( https://Github.com/HardlyStark )*

## Skills
I have a lot of skills in the field of red team and blue team and I worked in the field of hacking and security for thirteen years and provided security consulting or security services to many organizations.

## Open Source?
This is where I have to say that I hate the *Open Source* community and I will stay, but here I share some projects, exploits or tools that I feel should be made public or show their source code to others.

**That's enough :)**
